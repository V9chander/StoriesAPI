The lion woke up angrily and caught the mouse with his huge paw. 'How dare you disturb me? I will eat you!' roared the lion. The mouse trembled and pleaded, 'Please forgive me, mighty king. One day I may be able to help you.' The lion laughed loudly at the tiny creature's courage but decided to let it go. A few days later, the lion was caught in a hunter’s net. He roared and struggled but could not escape. Hearing his cries, the little mouse came running. With his sharp teeth, the mouse nibbled at the ropes until the lion was free.

With a wave of her wand, she transformed Cinderella’s rags into a sparkling gown and gave her glass slippers. A pumpkin turned into a carriage, and mice into horses. The fairy godmother warned her, 'The magic will end at midnight.' At the ball, Cinderella captivated the prince with her beauty and grace.
